                        <h2>Who we are?</h2>
                        <p>It all started with a dream: we were a group of 3 friends who were music and vinyl fans. Our hobby was to walk through the streets and look in every store for what we found interesting, it could be a cover, it could be something different that called our attention, soon we became friends with many people that ended up being part of this beautiful community.

                 <h2>Music</h2>
                 <p>Our staff works daily to provide the best to our customers, we have a wide variety of popular artists, classics and new era. Although our great specialty is jazz, bebop and R&B. 
                       <br> <br>
                  Our store also stands out for being an open space for all new artists or anyone who wants to share their music, so if you know how to play an instrument, what are you doing that we haven't seen you playing in our store?
